# [Project 1: E-news Express Project (Business statistics)](https://github.com/manyaobi1991/manyaobi1991.github.io/blob/main/README.md)

## Problem statement
* Information in the form of electronic news is one of the various ways people can get vital updates on a regular basis world wide. In comparison with newspapers, electronic news is extracted from a common database through which the contents are easily accessible to the general public through videos, audio channels, etc. An online news company known as E-news Express is currently looking at getting the attention of more news subscribers. The news platform works in such a way that users complete actions that best suits their interest and as such the company would like to understand those interests and explore ways to improve user experience. It has also come to the attention of the company management that there has been a rapid decline in new monthly subscribers as compared to the past year. It was also determined that the current webpage does not have the required content to engage and keep users for longer time to enable them subscribe to the news.

## Objectives
* This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that will help to conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will also be analyzed in this project.

## Methodology
The python libraries used for this projects are as follows:
* Pandas - For storing and manipulating structured data. Pandas functionality is built on NumPy
* Numpy â€“ For multi-dimensional array, matrix data structures and, performing mathematical operations
* Seaborn - For drawing statistical graphics with Matplotlib
* scipy.stats - For probability distributions, summary and frequency statistics, correlation functions and statistical tests.
* statsmodels.stats.proportion - For testing proportions based on normal z test
